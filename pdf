Abstract
Electronic Thesis and Dissertation System is a work submitted in support of candidature for a doctorate or master’s degree. Electronic version of theses and dissertations are called ETDs. This system is kind of Education website. In our system , users can search theses and dissertations of CU (Mdy) by Year, and can see abstract of the thesis, author name, supervisor name and the major. Users can also search books and theses of otago university and Global ETD for more references.
For admin Panel, admins can insert, data into database, delete and retrieve data for database. Users can use our system with both smart phones and computers. For Front End, the system was implemented using material design (HTML, CSS).For Back End, this system was implemented using javascript and jQuery. And we also used Firebase Hosting and Database.

Chapter 1
Introduction
1.1	Introduction































1.2	Background of the System
1.2.1	Evaluation of the literature relevant to the project area
I have to consider about the method, approach, programming language and tools in developing the project. Methodology will be used as I structure the project plan; it will represent how the project will be processed. Thus I structure the project’s framework. I need to consider about the project development. In the project area, I can use development life cycle model such as Agile Model in the project development life cycle. We use software Architecture as MVC. I must use UML techniques to propose the business processes in the project area; I can define the process notations by using UML diagrams. In order to code the program, I can use many computer language such as javascript, css, jquery,etc…

1.2.2	Development Life Cycle
   Development life cycle is used to describe in planning the business processes to create the system development and test and arrange the information system in the project area.
Agile Model
Agile Model breakdowns the project development into small incremental tasks and those task are processed in iteration process. The iteration process includes requirement analysis, design, coding and unit testing. So Agile Model can apply functional process of developing project rapidly and it is flexible model for developers. Backbone of Agile model is client communication, so if client does not understand what is meant to; the development team can be forward to the wrong direction. Technique I have to need to design process notations and make diagrams for the system design in the project area.
1.2.3	UML
Unified Modeling Language (UML) is used as to illustrate the object oriented systems and presentations. UML is a general architectural structure. It is derived from three notations; OMT(Object Modeling Technique), OOD(Object Oriented Design) and OOSE (Object Oriented Software Engineering). UML has a set of connectors and signs to use for drawing the diagram. These diagrams can represent the business process and functions from the companies or organizations by using UML. So we can model the computer code and program by using these diagrams. We can know about the business processes ideas by using UML diagrams in the project.
In this project, we can Use Case Diagram to describe a set of actions that can perform in collaboration with one or more external users of the system. We use sequence diagram to show object interactions arranged in time sequence.

1.2.4	HCI
     Human Computer Interaction is the study of how people interact with computers and to what extent computers are or not developed for successful interaction with human beings. A significant number of major corporations and academic institutions now study HCI. Human Computer Interface is joined as important part in every program or application because it defines user impressions. “User impression means how users can use the program effectively, if cannot attract the users to use.”
In this project, we use HCI to use color effectively. We have known that color blind people can see the color of blue. So, we almost used blue entire the project to accommodate with all people.
Transaction Control Language in DBMS
	A transaction is a logical unit of work that contains one or more SQL statements. A transaction is an atomic unit. The effects of all SQL statements in a transaction can be either all committed (applied to the database) or all back (undone from the database). A transaction begins with the first executable SQL statement. A transaction ends when it is committed or rolled back, either explicitly with COMMIT or ROLLBACK statement or implicitly when DDL statement is issued.



ER Diagram
	An entity relations model, also called an entity-relationship(ER) diagram, is a graphical representation of entities and their relationships to each other, typically used in computing in regard to the organization of data within databases or information systems. An entity is a piece of data-an object or concept about which data is stored.
We use ER diagram because to understand the relation of different entity (we can say tables) as per its name “Entity Relationship Diagram” in the database. It helps you to understand the whole structure of the back-end.
1.2.5 What is a firebase database?
A database is a collection of information that is organized so that it can be easily accessed, managed and updated.
Data is organized into rows, columns and tables, and it is indexed to make it easier to find relevant information. Data gets updated, expanded and deleted as new information is added. The Firebase Realtime Database is a cloud-hosted database. Data is stored as JSON and synchronized in realtime to every connected client. When you build cross-platform apps with our iOS, Android, and JavaScript SDKs, all of your clients share one Realtime Database instance and automatically receive updates with the newest data.
Computer database typically contain aggregations of data records or files, such as attendance transactions, attendance percentage and reports.
Typically, a database manager provides users with the ability to control read^write access, specify report generation and analyze usage. Some databases offer ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability) compliance to guarantee that data is consistent and that transactions are complete.
1.3	Objectives of the project

CHAPTER 2
METHDOLOGY
2.1 Requirement Analysis
       The description of the services and constraints are the requirements for the system. Requirement Analysis is the process of deriving the system requirements through observation of existing system, discussions with potential users and procurers, task analysis. We get all information of data we use in this project from our library.

2.2 Software Selection
Choose Programming Language
I would like to use HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, material design lite in my project because there are a lot of benefits to pick up languages in our windows form application.
•	HTML describes the structure of Web pages using markup.
•	CSS can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.It describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.
•	Javascript is a high-level and interpreted programming language.
•	JQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library.
•	Material Design Lite makes more liberal use of grid-based layouts, responsive animations and transitions, padding, and depth effects such as lighting and shadows.
•	They are readily available and easy to access.


Software Requirements
•	Firebase Database
Hardware Requirements
•	Internet Access
•	PC with Windows OS

CHAPTER 4
EVALUATION AND CONCLUSION
4.1	Conclusion
4.2	Advantages of the Project
The proposed system offers the following advantages:
•	It provides “faster and better” services to users.
•	This is helpful in assessing what’s in progress, what has written, the writing style, how it was structured, research methods, and which reference were used.
•	User can satisfy because they can search not only thesis title but also by year, supervisor name.
•	Assisting postgraduate students to write.
•	Provide facility for proper monitoring, reduces paper work and provide data security.

4.3 	Disadvantages
•	The cost of computer hardware and software programs can be expensive.
•	As mobile tablets use wireless network, they can disconnect with network if Wi Fi fails
4.4	Further Extensions
	This application has incompleteness from various view-points. But if it is continuously developed with experts, current needs will be covered  shortly, then the effectiveness will approve its property. Various functionalities can be embedded within the application.
